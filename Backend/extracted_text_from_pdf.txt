AI Developer
I'm a motivated AI developer with a solid background in Python, C, Java, and technologies like Machine
Learning, OOP, and basic web development . I enjoy exploring new areas like Prompt Engineering and finding
creative solutions to problems.
.
 ML models like Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree
Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression
is trained and with the help of Hyper parameter tuning its
accuracy is increased.
DL Built a deep learning model using InceptionV3 for
image classification, leveraging data augmentation to
improve generalization. Enhanced model performance
through evaluation metrics and fine-tuning techniques to
achieve higher accuracy.
